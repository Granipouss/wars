# Wars

> A Advance Wars clone written in TS.

Feel free to contribute. There is a lot remaining to be done.

## Architecture

_TODO..._

### Structure

The Project is split into 3 main parts

-   `engine` that is similar to a lib and include all the data and rules
-   `client` that is a front-end allowing to play the game
-   `server` that is a back-end with rooms to play multiplayer games

### Dependencies

-   [AWBW Wiki](https://awbw.fandom.com) is the reference for the rules and data
-   [Spriter Resources](https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/advancewarsds/) includes all the sprites used

-   [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is used for event and stream like behaviours
-   [Pixi](https://pixijs.com/) is used for 2d graphics
